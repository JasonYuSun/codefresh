Title: Cleaning Up GCP Service Accounts Created by Partial Terraform Execution Using a Break Glass Codefresh Pipeline

I. Introduction (50 words)
In this article, we will discuss how to clean up Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service accounts created by partial Terraform execution using an existing break glass Codefresh pipeline. This guide is designed for beginner DevOps engineers who want to keep their GCP resources tidy.

II. Understanding Terraform Plan and Apply Issues (100 words)
Terraform uses the 'plan' command to generate an execution plan, detailing the actions required to reach the desired infrastructure state. The 'apply' command executes the plan. However, sometimes 'plan' may succeed while 'apply' fails due to issues such as API errors, timeouts, or missing dependencies. This may result in the creation of unexpected GCP resources, such as orphaned service accounts.

III. Preparing the Break Glass Codefresh Pipeline (50 words)
Assuming you have an existing break glass Codefresh pipeline, we will add a new step to identify and delete GCP service accounts created by partial Terraform execution.

IV. Adding a Step to Delete GCP Service Accounts (250 words)
Follow these steps to add a new step in your break glass pipeline:

Identify service accounts: In your pipeline script, use the appropriate GCP CLI or SDK commands to list service accounts associated with the partial Terraform execution. Filter the list based on specific criteria, like account names or creation dates.
Example using the gcloud CLI:

```
gcloud iam service-accounts list \
  --project=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> \
  --filter="<FILTER_CRITERIA>" \
  --format="value(email)"
```

Delete service accounts: Loop through the filtered list and use the GCP CLI or SDK commands to delete each service account.
Example using the gcloud CLI:

```
for email in $(gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --filter="<FILTER_CRITERIA>" --format="value(email)")
do
  gcloud iam service-accounts delete $email --project=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --quiet
done
```
Add the script to your pipeline: Create a new step in your Codefresh pipeline and add the script you just wrote. Be sure to replace <YOUR_PROJECT_ID> and <FILTER_CRITERIA> with appropriate values.
Example pipeline step:

```
steps:
  delete_service_accounts:
    title: "Delete orphaned GCP service accounts"
    image: "google/cloud-sdk:latest"
    commands:
      - "gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"
      - |
        for email in $(gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --filter="<FILTER_CRITERIA>" --format="value(email)")
        do
          gcloud iam service-accounts delete $email --project=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID> --quiet
        done
```

Add a comment: Include a comment in your pipeline configuration file to inform the next user to clean up previous users' code before running the pipeline.
Example comment:
```
# Remember to clean up the code related to the service account deletion before running the pipeline.
```
V. Executing the Pipeline and Verifying Results (100 words)
After configuring the pipeline, you can execute it manually or via triggers. Once the pipeline runs, it will delete the GCP service accounts created by the partial Terraform execution. To verify the deletion, you can check the logs for successful deletion messages or run the gcloud iam service-accounts list command again to ensure that the targeted service accounts no longer exist.

VI. Conclusion (50 words)
Using abreak glass Codefresh pipeline to clean up GCP service accounts created by partial Terraform execution helps maintain a well-organized infrastructure. This method can be adapted to handle other GCP resources if needed. By following these steps and properly cleaning up after partial Terraform executions, DevOps engineers can ensure that their cloud environments remain efficient and streamlined.
